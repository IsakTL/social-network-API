This project is a challenge assignment for bootcamp, an exercise in MongoDB and Mongoose. It uses User and Thought models in its API calls. Currently, not all API functions are working. One is demonstrated in the following video: [https://youtu.be/chsC-I_nuhk](https://youtu.be/chsC-I_nuhk).

Starter code was taken from Module 17, mini-project.

## Instructions
Download the repo and follow the video - npm i, run build, run seed, and start. Then, use Insomnia to build out API calls. Future development: include Insomnia API calls as a JSON file in this repo.

## Usage
See above. Used for testing and experimenting with APIs.

## Contributing
Fork this project, or ask to contribute directly. I'd be surprised.

## Tests
A GET request to localhost:<port>/api/users, for example, should return all users.
